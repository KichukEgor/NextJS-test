# About This Project

This project is a **test assignment** to demonstrate my expertise in modern web development techniques. It includes semantic HTML, accessibility practices, animations, and performance optimizations.

## Features

- **Free API**: [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/)
- **Semantic HTML**: Tags like `<header/>`, `<main/>`, `<section/>`, and `<article/>` are used.
- **Technologies**: Developed with **Next.js 14**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**.
- **Animations**:
  - Smooth text appearance on scroll.
  - Parallax effects for background elements.
  - Custom page loading indicator.

## Accessibility

Implemented ARIA tags such as:
- `aria-label`
- `aria-hidden`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
